This is a port of the free GPIBUSB code here:

https://github.com/Galvant/gpibusb-firmware

For a proper readme, please refer to the original.

Some notes are tracked in the todo file, but is otherwise my own notes and rambling.  Some circuit details (namely pinout) are commented in the header of main.c.

This is provided as-is, and currently is not in a state I would normally release things in, but it does seem to work.

Cheers!
